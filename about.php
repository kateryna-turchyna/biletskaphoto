				<h3>Zhanna Biletska</h3>

				<p>Most of all I love photography. It`s my passion, my breathe. I like capturing moments in people`s lives! Whatever your story is I would be honored to tell it through my natural light style photographs. I am inspired by soft golden light that transforms even the most ordinary location into something extraordinary. I`m always chasing that dreamy light and like to make warm photos.</p>

				<p>I was born in Ukraine and living now in the USA. I have Bachelor of Architecture in Architectural Environment Design field of study; finished School of Art in Ukraine 2002- 2009. Participated in various Photography exhibitions in different cities.

				<p>I want to tell your story without being too posed, with a natural and candid approach, capturing that true emotion. My ideal vision of any photo session is to photograph people or moments as they are. Thank you for choosing me as your Photographer, I would be glad to share with you those special moments!</p>

				<p>I like to discover new places, meet new people, learn something new, and I am so excited to meet you!</p>
